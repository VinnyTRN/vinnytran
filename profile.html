				<h2>KhahTrn</h2>
				<p>Growing up with Youtube my entire life, I never found a lane which I could pursue this dream. Until 2016, when streetwear blew up. I decided to make sneakers, fashion, style hacks and unboxing content on Youtube, it was first just my passion. But it was quickly picked up by the audience and they fell in love with the relevant content relating to them.  I owe everything to my day ones, I wouldn't be anywhere I am today without them. Youtube became both a roller coaster and a dream for me. It helped me grow into a much better version of myself. Gave me a platform to share and inspire others. I'm going to use this platform to keep inspiring others to grow & succeed, live a better life. It's never too late to do something you truly love & believe in.
